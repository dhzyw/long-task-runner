# Long Task Runner

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md) · [Skill instructions](SKILL.md) · [MIT License](LICENSE)

Let Python handle slow commands, queues, waiting, retries, and routine checks. Keep the coding agent for planning, exceptional decisions, and final review.

An Agent Skill with a standard-library Python runner. Built and tested on **Windows / PowerShell**. Useful for video and 3D rendering, baking, local TTS, transcription, document conversion, builds, long tests, downloads, data jobs, and already-submitted remote jobs.

**This does not promise zero-token waiting.** A detached worker is not an agent completion notification. Whether the assistant can resume automatically depends on the actual host tools.

## Install

With the Skills CLI:

```sh
npx skills add dhzyw/long-task-runner --skill long-task-runner --agent codex
```

Or clone into your agent's supported personal skills directory. For current Codex on Windows:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dhzyw/long-task-runner.git "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\long-task-runner"
```

Do not install a second copy if the skill already exists elsewhere. Inspect executable skills before running them. Requires **Python 3.10+**; the core has no pip dependencies. The optional media checker needs existing FFmpeg / ffprobe.

Ask your agent:

> Use $long-task-runner to run this render batch using the existing scripts. Let the local runner wait, keep logs bounded, and verify the outputs before final review.

## Try a cheap local demo

From this repository, choose a new demo directory:

```powershell
python scripts/make_demo.py --directory ./work/demo --seconds 3
python scripts/runner.py start --spec ./work/demo/demo.json --job ./work/demo/job
python scripts/runner.py wait --job ./work/demo/job --seconds 25
```

The generated spec uses real absolute paths to your interpreter and the demo script. It performs no network or model calls. A successful result requires both exit code 0 and the expected JSON content.

## Interfaces

All commands take `--job <job-directory>`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start --spec job.json` | Persist the configuration and launch a hidden worker; repeated starts of the same job do not launch it again |
| `status [--since REVISION]` | Read one small snapshot; optionally coalesce changes by task |
| `wait --seconds 25` | Wait locally for a terminal state or a bounded window; at most 55 seconds per invocation |
| `cancel` | Request termination of the local process tree; check the resulting state |
| `resume --replay-safe` | Resume only tasks explicitly declared safe to replay; recheck and skip completed tasks |
| `logs --bytes 4096` | Read a bounded log tail when an error needs investigation |

`wait` exits 0 on success, 2 on failure/interruption, and 3 while still active. Successful control/status commands exit 0 even if the job itself failed: inspect the JSON `status`.

## Guarantees and limits

- Sequential queues, per-job time limits, cross-job resource locks, atomic JSON state, failure IDs, and bounded rotating logs.
- Retries are off by default. Automatic retries require an explicit safe-replay declaration and allowed nonzero exit codes. Timeouts and validation failures are not automatically replayed.
- External mutations and paid submissions cannot be automatically retried or resumed. A read-only remote watcher tracks an existing job ID; cancelling the watcher does not cancel remote execution or billing.
- Completion means exit status **and configured checks** passed. Built-in checks cover fresh/nonempty files, JSON assertions, complete WAV data and duration, SHA-256, and read-only validators. Final visual/audio/business review remains necessary.
- Windows Job Objects contain descendants and terminate them when the worker exits or crashes. Commands must run in the foreground until their work finishes; this is not a service manager.
- CPU/RAM/GPU limits belong in application parameters. Resource locks coordinate cooperating runners; they are not hardware quotas or distributed locks.
- macOS/Linux paths are experimental. Normal process-group cleanup exists; worker-crash recovery cannot offer Windows-equivalent containment and is blocked for unverified active remnants.
- Job identity hashes the JSON spec, not input files or scripts. Use a new job directory after changing inputs. A safe-replay flag is a caller assertion, not proof of idempotency.
- No agent/model client, scheduled automation, hidden wakeup bridge, or global configuration modification is built in. Authorized local inference commands such as TTS remain the user's workload.

## Tests and measurements

```powershell
python scripts/test_runner.py --root ./work/tests --report ./work/runner-tests.json
python scripts/test_remote.py --root ./work/tests --report ./work/remote-tests.json
python scripts/benchmark.py --directory ./work/benchmarks --report ./work/benchmark.json --seconds 6
```

The initial Windows validation passed 36 process tests and 8 loopback HTTP cases. It covered cancellation, worker crashes, duplicate starts, safe recovery, stale/corrupt outputs, validators, Unicode paths, log flooding, and coalesced events. See [CI](https://github.com/dhzyw/long-task-runner/actions) for checks on the published revision.

In one six-second demo, a local consumer making a status call every second used 8 CLI calls and returned 5,265 bytes; a consumer using one bounded wait used 2 calls and returned 1,434 bytes. Both consumers ran inside a local benchmark script. **These are interface calls and stdout/stderr bytes, not measured model requests, tokens, or billing savings.** Paths and timing affect the numbers; rerun the benchmark in your environment.

## Contributing

Focused fixes with reproductions are welcome. Keep the core dependency-free, keep logs bounded, preserve failure evidence and replay restrictions, and test Windows process cleanup when changing lifecycle code. Do not add new background agent calls or automatic external submissions.
